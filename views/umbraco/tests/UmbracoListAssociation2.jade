Believe me, I understand completely. But once you start, you will never look back. You'll discover that earning a BSN can provide you with greater work flexibility and open doors to a wide variety of career options. The key to earning your BSN is to remember that you're in a marathon, not a sprint. You don't have to finish tomorrow. But you do need to get started. Jacksonville University's online RN-to-BSN program is all about helping nurses gain the skills and credentials they need to get ahead. Our unique brand of online education means you can study when and where is convenient for you without hassling with evening or weekend commutes to campus. Our easy to use, multimedia format allows you to interact with professors and classmates as much as you would on campus. It's the ideal way to earn your degree while keeping up with family and work commitments. Our comprehensive curriculum helps you expand your expertise while you improve patient care and satisfaction. You'll learn the latest nursing concepts and techniques from faculty members who make individual attention a priority. Jacksonville University is a respected, accredited leader in nursing education. That's why thousands of nurses have chosen to continue their education at JU, which is ranked among the nation's premier teaching institutions. On behalf of Jacksonville University's online RN-to-BSN program, I encourage you to see for yourself how JU can help you strengthen your skills and take control of your career. Thank you for your interest, and I hope to have you in one of my classes.\\\n","thumbnailUrl":"//cdn.vidyard.com/thumbnails/182854/mJR-KGzxeOdXPSO95xUkVQ_small.jpg","keywords":"Why JU,BSN,ju","uploadDate":"2015-03-22T19:16:16+00:00","duration":"T01M55S","height":360,"width":640}

For example, based on the information you provide or that we collect, we may decide to inform you of existing Bisk products and services, including any of the programs that we feel may be of interest to you. We may also use the collected information to help develop new products and services that we think customers may find helpful in the future. With the goal of bringing you greater convenience and more choices, we make portions of your contact information (never financial information) available to affiliated companies that offer products and services that you also may enjoy and/or benefit from using.

In each case, we carefully review the company and the products and services offered to make sure that they provide value. If you do not wish to receive any or all such offers, please let us know by emailing us at any time at

                        | Our website may display or work with social media features or features from third parties which are approved vendors of social media networks (collectively known as “features”). These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Many of these features are a part of our advertising and communications efforts. If you choose to use these features, they may collect information about your interactions with our site, which may then be used by social media networks for various purposes.

                      p
                        | In order to comply with the Federal anti-spam laws effective January 1, 2004, we provide a suppression list of the e-mail addresses of those who ask to be removed from our distribution database to third party advertisers who provide e-mail marketing services to our company. We require all third party marketers to sign an agreement prohibiting them from using this data for any purpose other than sending out our marketing materials. It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Bisk to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations, employees or users.
